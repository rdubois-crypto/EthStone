# EthStone
A decentralized Rogue-like game

This project aims to implement a rogue-like game where a player owns heroes and fight for the control of maps with other players.
It is designed as an exercise for the Ledger's solidity guild. 

## Design Philosophy
As a decentralized game, the finality is to implement a game where:
- players own their asset heroes and conquered lands (maps)
- developpers are encouraged to contribute to the project by being rewarded by the contract when submitting:
  - new heroes and maps (solidity devs)
  - on top front environment
- main contract shall be fully decentralized at some point, replacing the current admin by a voting system (destroying ownership when implemented)
- cheat is prevented by design
